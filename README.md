## Description
CFLASH is a user-friendly flashcard application designed to streamline the learning process. With intuitive features, it allows users to create, organize, and review flashcards effortlessly. Whether studying for exams, learning new languages, or mastering concepts, CFLASH offers a versatile platform for users to enhance their knowledge retention and academic success.

## Motivation
I love learning, but it becomes a bit difficult sometimes especially when you're learning something new for the first time. It become very easy to confuse "recognition" with "recollection". Most people recognizes the answer to a question by looking at a small portion of it in thier notebook and they will say "yay i remember", after alreading seeing part of the answer. This action is called "recognition" where you can only remember using a form of hint. To truly recollect data from memory, you shouldn't be able to get an hint, this is where Flashcard comes to play. Instead of having to move around with bunch of flash cards all the time, i developed CFlash to digitalize the process and with it's simple and friendly user-interface, it makes learning not just fun but faster and better.
